# The NoiseBin Controller

The NoiseBin is an electronically enhanced sculpture that responds to visitors with engaging behaviour.

The sculpture also houses a container recycling bin that supports Western Australia's [Containers for Change](https://www.containersforchange.com.au/) initiative.
It was inspired by the [World's Deepest Bin](https://www.youtube.com./watch?v=cbEKAwCoCKw&t=25s) from Volkswagen of Sweden's [Fun Theory](https://web.archive.org/web/20171109195300/http://www.thefuntheory.com/worlds-deepest-bin) marketing campaign.  Visit the [NoiseBin Project](https://noisebin.org) site for the full story.
